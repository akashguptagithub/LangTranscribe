However, computing probabilities for all possible $y$ to find the maximizer is intractable. As a result, decoding strategies are employed to produce reasonable approximations of $y^*$.\n",

        "In the last module, you evaluated your models through different metrics, but the approach for generating outputs from the model was fixed to greedy decoding, where at each time step, the token to be produced is determined by $y_{i,greedy} := \\arg \\max_{y_i} P(y_i| x, y_{1:i-1})$. While this approach is fast, $P(y_{greedy}|x)$ may be much less than $P(y^*|x)$. Fortunately, better decoding strategies exist to produce better approximations, however at the cost of higher time complexity. Some of these are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Beam-Search Decoding**: At every time step, retains $k$ candidate token generations, which are decoded individually (each path is referred as a beam) to obtain $k$ successors per beam. For the next time step, the best $k$ candidates are retained such that conditional probability of the sequence generated so far is maximized. Has a complexity of $O(kV|y|)$, where $V$ is the size of the target vocabulary, and $|y|$ is the target sequence length. Using $k=1$ makes it equivalent to greedy decoding. Implementations also employ length penalties to not be biased towards larger target sequences.\n",

Works well under assumptions of a small target vocabulary size and conditional independence of feature vectors. The decoded sequence has the minimum error probability possible when compared to $y^*$, i.e., $P(y_{viterbi}|x) \\sim P(y^* | x)$. Has a time complexity of $O(V^2|y|)$.\n",
